# Kitodo.Production

Kitodo.Production is a workflow management tool for mass digitization and is part of the Kitodo Digital Library Suite.

Kitodo.Production supports various types of materials such as prints, periodicals, manuscripts, sheet music and typical documents of a *Nachlass*. The software is written in Java, uses Java Server Faces web technology to run on a [Tomcat Servlet container](http://tomcat.apache.org/), and is backed by a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) database utilizing the [Hibernate framework](http://www.hibernate.org) to access it.

## Kitodo. Digital Library Modules

[Kitodo](https://github.com/kitodo) is an open source software suite intended to support mass digitization projects for cultural heritage institutions. Kitodo is widely used and cooperatively maintained by major German libraries and digitization service providers. The software implements international standards such as METS, MODS, ALTO, and other formats maintained by the Library of Congress. Kitodo consists of several independent modules serving different purposes such as controlling the digitization workflow, enriching descriptive and structural metadata, and presenting the results to the public in a modern and convenient way.

## Docker instructions

The Docker images were built by [Mannheim University Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannheim_University_Library).

Simply use docker-compose for setting up and running Kitodo:

    # OPTIONAL: retrieve image with tag TAG from Docker Hub
    docker pull kitodo/production:TAG
    # build image for Kitodo version specified in .env if it
    # is not available locally, build and start containers
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose logs -f

If everything worked, Kitodo.Production can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/kitodo with initial credentials `testAdmin / test`.

The configuration as well as the Elasticsearch and SQL databases are bound to directories inside the local directory by default. This can be changed in the `docker-compose.yml` file, as well as the port settings.

The kitodo SQL database can be accessed with: `docker exec -ti kitodo-production-docker_db_1 mysql kitodo`
